# Week 0
<P>I already have idea on git & github + i already have flutter installed beforehand (I'm noob in flutter tho)</p> <p> I thought we cant run on vsc till now as I used android studio till now for running on emulator...</p>
<p> and about running the app everything went smooth except im using older version of flutter and i neglected the warning which wasted some time for me but eventually somehow figured it out and for turning it into red from blue is a piece of cake as it is just changing the theme data and changing the text is just changing line 98...and later realized i didnt do some things and its different from just changing but i dont understand how to google this but first i wanna try on my own so i tried and somehow removed the count showing thing but i removed add button widget by mistake i will see changes and add it soon ...ðŸ˜¢</p>
</p> with help of a friend and google i found my mistake and added floating button too so i guess completed but i feel like this is not the way to proceed because its like idk anything in flutter but still trying to do something with it idk isnt it better to create something by knowing it? afaik this isnt oriented towards beginners exactly i meant about last one ah idk this might be a better way too</p>
